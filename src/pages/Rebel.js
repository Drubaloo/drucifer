                I bet you're the kind of person who loves to create. I know I am. That's why I got into web development. To me, coding is an art form. It's a way to express my creativity and bring my ideas to life. That's why I built this website with React and ThreeJS. To combine my love of 3d design with the wild web.

                As much as I enjoy coding, it's not the only way I express my creativity. When I'm not building websites, you might find me tinkering with electronics or firing up my 3D printer. There's something incredibly satisfying about taking a broken piece of tech and bringing it back to life, or designing and printing a custom object from scratch. For me, 3D printing and electronics repair are more than just hobbies - they're an extension of my love for problem-solving and creating something from nothing.
